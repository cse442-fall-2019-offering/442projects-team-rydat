Hashtags and descriptions shuold all be in the first line of commits.
Desciptions should be brief, shorter than this sentence.

Remember to separate out user stories/tasks with labels before grading for Sprint 3.

User story - Alan - caching user data to allow for multiple users
User story - Yong - UI overall
User story - Taktuk - speech to text
User story - Rob - further development of old playlist options

Make sure to clean up ZenHub before grading, all user stories have tasks and tests, all issues are placed into the correct category.
