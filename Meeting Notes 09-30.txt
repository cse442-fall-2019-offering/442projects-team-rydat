09/30 Meeting Notes
Start of sprint 2

- Need core functionality of project.
	A basic functioning website "with music sounds".
	Do something each week - don't save it all for the end.
	Each user story needs a breakdown into techincal tasks.
	Tasks are separate issues, should be labelled as "task"	
	Every task (and every user story) needs an accpetance test in the comments.

	Branches should be based on user stories, not tasks. 
	Commit messages need hashtags.
	
	User stories were assigned, will check progress next week.
