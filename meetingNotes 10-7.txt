meeeting notes  from 10/7/19


We need to make sure to create tasks for
every assigned User Story and assign those
tasks to ourselves

We will not be penalized for using the Django database vs the one provided.
Luke encouraged us to use the Django data base

Taktuk was assigned the task of Linking user autentication 

we need Tasks Test to be confirmed/done
before before moving them from review/QA to
done.

User stories and acceptance tests are not techincal and are for the client.

Tasks and Task test are fully technical and 
are for the software engineers. 
ex "running some script in some directory"

we can only assign ourselves user stories 
only if they are absolutely necessary for
the sprint. We can assign ourselves new tasks freely though.

Luke was made aware of the potential issue
with extracting emotional context
