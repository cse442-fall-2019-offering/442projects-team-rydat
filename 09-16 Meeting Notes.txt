09/16 Meeting Notes

EVERY commit must be assigned to a user story - this includes random file deletions,
bug fixes, etc. Assignments can be made by using # plus the issue number associated
with the user story.

At the end of a sprint, the only things graded are the Master branch and ZenHub.

User stories should have a simple, informative title. The actual story part following the
"As ___, I want ___, so ___" should be in the comments.

Acceptance tests should be attached to the bottom of all "completed" user stories.
Can be as simple as links, but must outline the process to verify that a user story
has actually been completed.
