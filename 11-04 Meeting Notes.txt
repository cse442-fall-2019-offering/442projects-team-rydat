Dakota had finished his story and only needs to write his task tests

We have decided to switch from the CSE department to Alan's personal server
it may take him upto the weekend to complete transferring everything to the
server due to difficulty he has completing 2-factor authentication.

Dakota is making a new user story for accounting for other ways to
better personalize the generated playlists

Taktuk will begin to start working on the music visualizer
